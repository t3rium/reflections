What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
New hidden folder .git is created. It holds metainformation about the current folder and subfolders. In this way you add some directory to be tracket by Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is tracked by your local git but it's not accessible by other people. You can group a number of changes in staging area and then execute single commit to add them as logical unit to common project.
