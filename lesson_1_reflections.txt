1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allows check only changed part of the file which is much faster than checking all the file. It's good for big files and small changes but probably not so efficient for small files and big changes.


2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This way you can make changes not only from the last version but from any version if it would be needed. Fixing bugs is much easier.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros:
You can havelogically organized changes.

cons:
You have to remember that you need to commit changes.


4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git supports idea of tracking logical changes to a group of files. Google docs doesn't support logical changes separation.


5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all changes history for given repository, diff shows what has changed between 2 versions of repository.
