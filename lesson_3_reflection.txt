When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with other people or when I plan to work on one project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if someone adds changes which may conflict with your local version you'd better to control when this conflict should be resolved.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a GitHub feature it's just adds a link between your repository and repository you have copied it from. Clones are just copies of remote repositories to your local machine. Branches are different versions of your local repository.

What is the benfit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can see difference between your working copy and remote and merge it without access to internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and would be harder?
If you set aside other vcs than you could send changed files via email or pass them in some other way. It would be easier because you don't need to learn how to use Git. But working with conflicting changes, working from different machines and looking through history would be much more difficult if not impossible.
